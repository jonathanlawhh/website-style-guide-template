## FAQs?
<b>Q:</b> The design you provided sucks <br>
<b>A:</b> I am just sharing a skeleton 'template', so feel free to beautify it your way ðŸ˜‰

<b>Q:</b> I am using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap, can I still use this?<br>
<b>A:</b> Yes you definitely can! Either import your own CSS after the framework, or create an internal CSS. Just ensure your new styles override the framework design without breaking their layout. And as always, test, test, and test.
